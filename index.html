                        free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks
                        was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
                        successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. Lorem ipsum dolor

                        needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                        program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
                        were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
                        agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
                        learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
                        have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
                        example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
                        job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
                        recommend!"
